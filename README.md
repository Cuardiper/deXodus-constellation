DeXodus is the next generation decentralized perpetual exchange for everyone. This project was born out of sweat, blood and copious amounts of ayran during the legendary hackathon of ETH Global Istanbul 2023. 

We wanted to thank everyone who helped bring this event together and wish the best of luck to all our competitors who have shared this experience with us. We had an amazing time and we hope you all did as well.

To immortalize the event, we have developed a few unique traits (ETH Global beanie, T-shirt and shish kebab) for our NFT collection that will be airdropped exclusively to the first 40 users that interacts use Dexodus in testnet. We hope you like it and look forward to your feedback!

## Tech Stack
At Dexodus, our innovative approach relies on a tailored tech stack, offering customized futures contracts for enhanced efficiency in gamification features and more. Here's an overview of the functionalities:

- Customized Futures Contracts: Engineered in-house to achieve tailored efficiency standards for gamification features and functionalities.
- Proprietary Liquidity Pool: Our internally-managed liquidity pool ensures efficient auto-compounding mechanisms.
- ZKSync Deployment: Leveraging ZK Rollups for swift, decentralized, and secure transactions on ZKSync. For futures functionality, users incur no transaction fees, thanks to paymasters utilizing account abstraction.
- TheGraph Integration: Facilitating automatic position liquidation, historical position access, powering trader tournaments, rankings, and copy trading.
- API3 and Chainlink Integration: Utilized for price feeds and randomization of NFTs, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
- IPFS + Filecoin: Employed for heightened decentralization and data persistence, enhancing the durability and distribution of our data storage infrastructure.
- This tech arsenal empowers Dexodus with cutting-edge functionalities, superior efficiency, and an unparalleled level of security and decentralization.

## Liquidity Pool
The liquidity pool in Dexodus allows users to contribute USDC tokens to the pool in exchange for LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens. For instance, a user adding 1,000 USDC might receive 10,000 LPX tokens, with each LPX token initially valued at 0.10 USDC.

As traders engage in transactions on the platform, statistics suggest that on average, they might incur losses. These losses ultimately contribute to filling the liquidity pool with additional USDC funds. Importantly, the USDC that flows into the liquidity pool becomes directly available for traders' use, facilitating the autocompounding of rewards for liquidity providers. This feature allows providers to passively generate returns without active engagement in the pool or the protocol.

When a liquidity provider decides to withdraw their USDC holdings, they can simply return the LP tokens. Notably, the LP tokens will have appreciated in value due to the accumulation of additional USDC and potential trading fees within the pool. The provider can actively monitor the fluctuation of LPX token prices in real-time on the frontend interface.

This functionality offers a straightforward yet powerful mechanism for liquidity providers to contribute to the pool, passively accumulate rewards through autocompounding, and withdraw their assets at an appreciated value, all while actively monitoring their investment.

## Perpetual Trading
Dexodus offers a groundbreaking approach to trading where users can engage in trading activities without the necessity of holding ETH in their wallets.

At present, the platform allows trading exclusively on BTC and ETH, with plans to introduce additional tokens in the future.
Currently, users can execute long positions, and the platform will soon support short positions as well.

Traders can interact with the futures contract to engage in perpetual trading activities. The following functionalities are currently enabled:
Open Position: Enables the initiation of a trading position.
Increase Position: Allows the augmentation of a position by adding more collateral and leverage.

Decrease Position (Keep Ratio): Permits the reduction of a position (or partial exit) while maintaining the collateral-to-leverage ratio.
Close Position: Allows the complete closure of a position, returning the entire leverage and settling any associated fees.

Future enhancements to the platform will include:
- Limit Orders: Introducing conditional orders where users can set long or short positions based on specific price levels and exit conditions.
- Increase Collateral: Capability to increase collateral for a specific position.
- Decrease Collateral: Capability to reduce the collateral associated with a position.

Dexodus aims to continually expand its functionalities, ensuring a comprehensive trading experience while prioritizing flexibility and user control over trading strategies.

## NFT Gamification
#### NFT Issuance
NFTs can be acquired by opening chests or purchasing them directly from the marketplace. Upon opening chests, NFTs are acquired randomly, each possessing distinctive properties:
- Evolution: NFTs have five evolution types, requiring four identical NFTs at maximum experience to evolve.
- Age: NFTs have varying ages, affecting the experience required to level up.
- Experience: Older NFTs require more experience to level up.
- Genetics: Genetics provide a boost to the yield generated and the power within the protocol. Rarity depends on the NFT's traits, determining its impact.

#### NFT Arena
The core gamification feature allows NFTs to be trained in the NFT Arena. Users can simultaneously have a bull and a bear in the NFT Arena. Successful long trades enhance the bull's experience, while successful short trades boost the bear's experience.

#### NFT Gaming
NFTs will eventually be usable in community-made mini-games to generate yields. Until the first mini-game is developed, leveled-up NFTs can be staked. NFTs have a weight, contributing to yield generation within the protocol.

## Staking: NFTs & EXD
Both NFTs and EXDs can be staked to earn yields and additional utilities within the Dexodus ecosystem.

Staking rewards will be derived from:
- Linear EXD Token Issuance: Stakers will receive yields through a linear token issuance of EXD.
- USDC from Generated Fees: Yield generation will be supplemented by a portion of fees collected, primarily from trading and borrowing fees.

Users participating in staking activities with their NFTs and EXDs will not only earn yields but also contribute to the overall liquidity and stability of the protocol, thereby enhancing the ecosystem's health and incentivizing long-term engagement.

## Leagues & Seasons

Within Dexodus, traders have the opportunity to compete in trader leagues during each season, which will last for a duration of two weeks. These leagues are divided into different divisions, each represented by different animals: rabbit, deer, buffalo, and elephant. Moving up from one league to another will require traders to be among the best from the previous season. The top traders from each league will receive monetary rewards at the end of each season, along with NFTs and chests.

Traders compete simultaneously in an absolute and relative ranking. The absolute ranking takes into account the absolute net PnL, that is, the total gains of the trader. Meanwhile, the relative ranking considers the PnL in relation to the size of the positions managed. This allows a trader to compete in a division, for example, in the rabbit division in the absolute ranking, but in the buffalo division in the relative ranking, due to the comparison of their profits with the size of their operations.

Traders will have the option to access a higher league by paying, but staying in that league will depend entirely on their performance.
